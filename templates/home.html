    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Migraines are a common neurological condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Despite their prevalence, there remains a significant lack of awareness about the condition. Many people suffer in silence, unaware that their headaches are actually migraines.</p>
  
    <h2>Lack of Awareness and Understanding</h2>
    <p>Many individuals experiencing migraines do not realize the nature of their condition. Symptoms such as intense headaches, sensitivity to light and sound, nausea, and visual disturbances can be debilitating. However, without proper awareness, these symptoms are often dismissed or misunderstood, leading to inadequate care and support.</p>
  
    <h2>Challenges in Diagnosis and Support</h2>
    <p>Getting a proper diagnosis for migraines can be challenging. The process often involves multiple consultations with healthcare providers, as well as ruling out other potential causes of the symptoms. This can be frustrating and time-consuming. Additionally, due to the invisible nature of migraines, those suffering may struggle to get the necessary support from employers, educators, and even family members.</p>
  
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Raising awareness about migraines is crucial for improving the lives of those affected. Understanding the symptoms, seeking appropriate medical advice, and fostering a supportive environment can make a significant difference in managing this condition.</p>
